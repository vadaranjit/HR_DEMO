Q.15)

Both joins and set operators are used in SQL to combine data from two or more tables. 

join:
1.Joins are used to combine columns from two or more tables based on a related column between the tables.
2.There are different types of joins, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

set operator:
1.Set operators are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.
2.The four set operators in SQL are UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.

Q.16)What is data integrity

Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data over its entire lifecycle. It is the process of ensuring that data is complete, correct, and consistent throughout its entire lifespan, from creation to deletion. Data integrity is a critical aspect of data management and is essential for ensuring the usability and reliability of data.
Data integrity can be achieved through various methods, including:Data validation,data normalisation

Q.17)What is data perging
Data purging, also known as data pruning or data cleansing, is the process of permanently deleting or removing data from a database or other data storage system. This is typically done to remove data that is no longer needed, outdated, or inaccurate, and to free up storage space.
Data purging is typically done for the following reasons:
1.To improve system performance
2.To protect sensitive data
3.To reduce storage costs

BIG DATA

Q)Internal and external tables

In Hive, an internal table and an external table are two different types of tables that are used to store data. 
The main difference between the two is in how they handle data storage and management.

Internal Table:

Internal tables store data in the HDFS in a Hive-managed location.
Hive is responsible for managing the internal table's data, including data backup and metadata.
When an internal table is dropped, both the metadata and the data stored in the table are deleted.
Internal tables are used for Hive-specific data processing, such as creating partitions and indexes.

  External Table:

External tables store data in a user-specified location in HDFS or in an external file system.
External tables rely on the user or external application to manage the data stored in the table.
When an external table is dropped, only the metadata is deleted, and the data stored in the external location remains intact.
External tables are typically used for integrating data from multiple sources or for performing analysis on data stored outside of Hive.

In summary, an internal table is fully managed by Hive and stores data in a Hive-managed location, 
while an external table is not managed by Hive and stores data in a user-specified location. 
The choice between internal and external tables depends on the use case and requirements of the specific data processing scenario.


Q)what is data partition and bucketing

partitioning and bucketing are techniques used in big data systems to improve data processing and querying performance.
 Partitioning divides data based on a specific column or set of columns, 
while bucketing divides data into buckets or groups based on a hash function applied to a specific column.
 Both techniques can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.
